# Java Operators and Control Flow Assignment

## Overview
This assignment will help you practice using Java operators and control flow statements. You'll write code to solve various real-world problems using:
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- If statements
- If-else statements
- If-else if-else statements

## Getting Started
1. Accept the assignment link from GitHub Classroom
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE
4. Locate the `Assignment.java` file in the `src/main/java` directory

## Your Task
Complete the following methods in `Assignment.java`:

1. `calculateMovieNight()`: Calculate the total cost for a family movie night
2. `canRentCar(int age)`: Determine if someone can rent a car based on age
3. `isValidPasswordLength(String password)`: Check if a password meets length requirements
4. `needsOilChange(int mileage, int lastChangeMileage)`: Determine if a car needs an oil change
5. `getDivisibleByThreeMessage(int number)`: Create a message for numbers divisible by 3
6. `getLeapYearMessage(int year)`: Determine if a year is a leap year
7. `getTicketPriceCategory(int age)`: Determine ticket price category based on age

Each method has detailed comments explaining what it should do and what to return.

## Testing Your Code
- The project includes unit tests in `AssignmentTest.java`
- Run the tests to check if your implementations are correct
- All tests must pass to receive full credit
- You can run the tests:
  - Through your IDE
  - Using Maven: `mvn test`

## Requirements
- Do not modify the method signatures (names, parameters, return types)
- Do not modify the test file
- Each method must use the appropriate operators and control flow statements
- Follow Java naming conventions and style guidelines
- Add comments to explain your logic where necessary

## Grading
Your assignment will be graded automatically when you push your code to GitHub. The grading criteria are:
- All tests must pass
- Code must compile without errors
- Methods must be implemented according to specifications

## Tips for Success
1. Read the comments for each method carefully
2. Test your code with different input values
3. Make sure you understand the requirements before starting
4. Commit and push your changes frequently
5. Check the GitHub Actions tab to see if your code passes all tests

## Getting Help
If you have questions or need help:
1. Review the lecture notes on operators and control flow
2. Check the Java documentation
3. Ask questions during class or office hours
4. Post questions in the course discussion forum

## Submission
- Commit and push your code to GitHub
- Verify that all tests pass in GitHub Actions
- Submit before the deadline

Good luck!
